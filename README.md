# ShapeClassifier
This project explores how deep learning models can classify simple geometric shapes such as **triangles** and **circles**.  
The dataset is **synthetically generated** using `matplotlib`, making the pipeline fully reproducible and easy to extend.  

Currently, the repository contains a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** implementation, with plans to add a **Vision Transformer (ViT)** model for comparison.  

### Highlights
-  Synthetic dataset generation (triangles, circles â€” no external data required)  
-  Data augmentation for stronger generalization  
-  Custom CNN for lightweight shape classification  
-  K-Fold cross-validation for robust evaluation  
-  Training visualization (loss & accuracy curves)  
-  **Future work:** Vision Transformer (ViT) integration
